Each problem we generate is in a particular tax law area, consisting of a question and four to seven potential answers. The areas are as follows.

Check the box. The issue is whether a given business entity is eligible to select its tax status (for example, corporation, partnership, disregarded entity), or whether it is required to be classified as a corporation, and, if it is eligible to select its tax status, what its default status would be, and what status it would be able to elect into. Selecting a tax status is known colloquially as “checking the box.”  

Restricted property as compensation (two types). Some of these problems ask how much of a deduction an employee is permitted to take when the employee receives property as compensation; the terms of the compensation require the employee to forfeit the property if certain conditions are not met; and the conditions are in fact not met and the employee must forfeit the property (restricted property as compensation/employee). Other problems ask how much of a deduction the employer is permitted to take due to transfer of restricted property as compensation (restricted property as compensation/employer).

Unrestricted property as compensation. These problems ask about the treatment of employees who receive unrestricted property as compensation, in particular the amount gain that these employees have when they sell the property they have received as compensation. 

Basis of property transferred as gift. These questions require determining the basis of property transferred as a gift, and in particular focus on the “dual basis rule,” which requires a different basis for property transferred on gift for purposes of determining loss, on the one hand, as opposed to gain, on the other hand..  

Part gift/part sale (two types). These questions require determining how much gain a donor/seller recognizes on a transfer that is part gift/part sale (gain from part gift/part sale), or the recipient’s basis is in the property that is received in a part gift/part sale transfer (basis from part gift/part sale).  

Basis from part donation/part sale. These questions require determining how much gain a donor/seller recognizes on a transfer to a tax-exempt entity that is part donation/part sale.
  
Basis of property transferred at death. These questions require determining the basis of property that was acquired from a decedent.

Qualified business income deduction. These questions require determining the amount of deduction is available under the qualified business income deduction provision, Section 199A.
