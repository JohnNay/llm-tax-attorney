Kyrie's taxable income is $347,000, which is less than the threshold amount of $364,200. Therefore Section 199A(d)(3) permits Kyrie to take the 199A deduction even though a physical therapy clinic is a specified service trade or business under Section 199A(d)(1)(A). The taxable income limitation could apply. 20% of the qualified business income equals 20% of $208,800, which equals $41,760. 20% of taxable income less capital gain equals 20% of $247,000, for a total of $49,400. Therefore, because 20% of qualified business income is less than the taxable income limitation, the taxable income limitation does not reduce the available deduction.", ["199A"]],
