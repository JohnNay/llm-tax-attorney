["Braylee owns property that is worth $48,000, with a basis of $42,000. Braylee dies and leaves the property to Grant. Several years later, Grant sells the property for $56,000. How much gain or loss does Grant recognize due to their sale of the property for $56,000? (1) $0 (2) $8,000 (3) $9,875 (4) $13,000 (5) $14,000 (6) $23,000", "(2) $8,000", "https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1014 Correct! Under Section 1014(a), the basis of the asset is set to the fair market value at the time of death. Therefore Grant recognizes $56,000 - $48,000 = $8,000 on the subsequent sale.", ["1014(a)"]],
["Alessandra owns property that is worth $49,000, with a basis of $52,000. Alessandra gives the property to Dakota. Alessandra and Dakota are good friends. Several years later, Dakota sells the property for $54,000. How much gain or loss does Dakota recognize due to his sale of the property for $54,000?

Because the value at the initial transfer was less than the basis, the dual basis rule applies as described in Section 1015(a). Here, however, the ultimate sale price was greater than the basis in the hands of the transferor, so the recipient uses the transferred basis. Dakota therefore recognizes $54,000 - $52,000 = $2,000.", ["1015(a)"]]
